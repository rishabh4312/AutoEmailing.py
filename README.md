# AutoEmailing.py
Send email with an automatic sign in.

Firefox and required modules need to be installed in system
in order to use this.

I have coded in python to send an email using command line 
arguments.Your credentials need to be updated in this code.
Run this python program and provide first argument as 
recepient's email id and second argument as a subject and 
third argument as the message.

Finally hit enter and email would be sent in front of your eyes
without interacting with the system.
